# javascript-Projects
A collection of Vanilla javascript projects

A collection of projects made with vanilla Javascript, html and css. A few projects show the difference between using 'onclick' events in html
vs. using addEventListener in javascript. Lot's of lovely ES6 sprinkled in here as well. 

I also tend to add quite a lot of comments in my javascript (mostly for myself, but also for anyone else who cares to read it).
