# javascript-Projects
A collection of Vanilla javascript projects

A collection of projects made with vanilla Javascript, html and css. A few projects show the difference between using 'onclick' events in html
vs. using addEventListener in javascript. Of course, all of these were styled in css by myself, so please forgive my super amazing
1990's styling on some of the projects.
