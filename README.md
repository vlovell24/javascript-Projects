# javascript-Projects
A collection of Vanilla javascript projects

A collection of projects made with vanilla Javascript, html and css. A few projects show the difference between using 'onclick' events in html
vs. using addEventListener in javascript. Of course, all of these were styled in css by myself, so please forgive my super amazing
1990's styling on some of the projects. 

I also tend to add quite a lot of comments in my javascript (mostly for myself, but also for anyone else who cares to read it).
